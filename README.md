* **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can create, read, update, and delete rental listings.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user login/registration using **Passport.js**.
* **User Profiles:** Separate listings and reviews tied to specific users.
* **Review System:** Users can add and delete reviews for listings.
* **Database Management:** Utilizes **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for data modeling.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled using **Bootstrap 5** for a seamless experience on all devices.
* **Cloud Hosting:** Configured for image uploads using Cloudinary (based on `cloudConfig.js` file presence).
